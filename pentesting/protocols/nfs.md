# NFS

## <mark style="color:yellow;">ABOUT</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**Network File System (NFS)**</mark> is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to <mark style="color:purple;">**access file systems over a network**</mark> as if they were local. NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. The `/etc/exports` file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Dangerous Settings</mark>

* <mark style="color:green;">**`rw`**</mark> - Read and write permissions.
* <mark style="color:green;">**`insecure`**</mark> - Ports above 1024 will be used.
* <mark style="color:green;">**`nohide`**</mark> - If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry.
* <mark style="color:green;">**`no_root_squash`**</mark> - All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.

1. Basic nmap footprinting

```bash
sudo nmap --script nfs* 13.13.13.13 -sV -p111,2049
```

2. Show available NFS shares

```bash
showmount -e 13.13.13.13
```

3. Mounting & Unmounting NFS shares

```bash
> mkdir target-NFS
> sudo mount -t nfs 13.13.13.13:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
> sudo umount ./target-NFS
```
