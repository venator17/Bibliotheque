# DLL Hijacking

## <mark style="color:yellow;">About</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**DLL injection**</mark> is a method that <mark style="color:purple;">**involves inserting a piece of code**</mark>, structured as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), <mark style="color:purple;">**into a running process**</mark>. This technique allows the inserted code to run within the process's context, thereby influencing its behavior or accessing its resources.
