# Mindset

## <mark style="color:orange;">Mindset</mark>

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #1 — Think for yourself.</mark>

**Fuck the herd. Don’t let anyone else rule you. Trust your own mind, and draw your own lines.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #2 — Burn for it.</mark>

**Knowledge without fire = dead facts. If it doesn’t spark, ditch it. Same as sex — without heat, it’s just hollow motions.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #3 — Hacking is a worldview.</mark>&#x20;

**Everything’s a system — social, moral, political. Every system has cracks. Find them, pry them open, see where it bleeds.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #4 — Find the exploit, document, move on.</mark>

**Don’t worship one achievement. Break, learn, log it, leave. The next feat is already waiting.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #5 — Practice where it counts.</mark>

**CTFs, labs, home rigs — that’s the weight room. You don’t get sharp without grinding steel on steel.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #6 — Filter the noise, keep the signal.</mark>

**Your head’s chaos. Structure it. Kill distractions, chase the patterns when needed.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #7 — Music is the engine.</mark>

**Industrial, ambient, rock, etc. Noise that makes your heart pumping, or quiets excessive thoughts**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #8 — Loyalty > crowd.</mark>

**Fuck the masses. Save your fire for the few who matter. Guard your circle, the rest is static.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #9 — Burnout is real — schedule silence.</mark>

**You can’t be “on” forever. Shut it down. Meditate, walk, sleep, disappear. Come back harder.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #10 — Be visible but unreadable.</mark>

**Black tee, bomber, scuffed kicks. Look simple, stay unreadable. Let them think they’ve got you figured out — then show they never did if needed.**

#### <mark style="color:red;">Rule #11 — Reputation is made in silence.</mark>

**Talk less. Deliver more. Noise fades, results don't.**
