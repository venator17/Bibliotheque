## THIS WEBSITE

This website / project is inspired by **HackTricks**, and basically is my library ( this is where the name **Bibiliotheque** came out ) of knowledge, where you can learn basics, or remember things you forgot (which was the initial reason of making site) or just to have a **nice portable cheatsheet**.&#x20;

By reading this website you can notice (especially on the newer sections) that I use a lot of color for better user experience.

**Principles behind each color is same** _( BUT this is a **principle**, not a **rule**, so sometimes I can change that in terms of better readability, taste or some other reasons )_

* <mark style="color:red;">**Red**</mark> - Terms, abbreviations that are used for the first time or the second time.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Purple**</mark> -  Synonym in conjunction with red, if not, then simply to emphasize something.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Yellow**</mark> - Points, important things, things to pay attention to, things that should catch the eye.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Blue**</mark> - Subpoints, emphasizing something.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Green**</mark> - Commands, Tools.
* <mark style="color:orange;">**Orange**</mark> - For caution, important information.
